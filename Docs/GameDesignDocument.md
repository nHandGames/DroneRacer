## A Drone Racing Game

### Concept:
DroneRacer is an open-world head-to-head drone racing game where a player can select different areas to go to and race their drone against an AI drone or against another player.

The focus will be on flow and feel.

Each area/scene will feature randomly suspended track obstacles (e.g. scoring loops) and other game assets for that scene.

### Rules:

* Player(s) start with finite health.
* Colliding with obstacles causes damage and reduces health.

### Requirements:
* SFX: Drone engine sound, obstacle collision sound, start race countdown timer beeps
* Music: Background music to create tension

### Marketplace Items:
Scenes and assets will also be packaged and made available for individual sale in the various game engine and 3d modeling marketplaces (e.g. Unreal Engine Marketplace, Artstation3D).
* Meshes will be available in both low resolution and high resolution versions
* [Detailed Mesh Requirements Will Go Here]

Other aspects of this game will also be modularized and sold individually. For example:
* Racing countdown clock with HUD display and sound tones
* Pickup inventory system
